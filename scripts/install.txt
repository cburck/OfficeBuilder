1) Add "127.0.0.1 office-builder" to /etc/hosts

2) Clone OfficeBuilder project directory locally from GitHub. Note local path.

3) Update Apache vhost config. The following VHOST config is standard and should work with v2.2 (updating paths as defined in step 2):

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName office-builder
  DocumentRoot /..../OfficeBuilder/public
  SetEnv STORAGE_PATH /..../OfficeBuilder/data

  <Directory "/..../OfficeBuilder/">
      Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


4) Create directory /..../OfficeBuilder/data and make fully accessible to web server. You may need to create "cache", "configs", "files", "logs", "sessions", and "temp" directories inside data if app cannot create them when executed for the first time.

5) Create MySQL database "OfficeBuilder", and create MySQL user "OfficeBuilder" with password "OfficeBuilderLocal" (this is set in applications/configs/application.ini)

6) Apply scripts/schema.sql to database "OfficeBuilder"

7) Apply default data set scripts/data.sql to database "OfficeBuilder"

8) Restart Apache, tail its error log, and browse "http://office-builder/"
