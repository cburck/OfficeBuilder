1) Add "127.0.0.1 office-builder" to /etc/hosts

2) Clone OfficeBuilder project directory locally from GitHub. Note local path.

3) Update Apache config. The following VHOST config is standard and should work with v2.2:

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName office-builder
  DocumentRoot /Users/cburck/OfficeBuilder/OfficeBuilder/public
  SetEnv STORAGE_PATH /Users/cburck/OfficeBuilder/OfficeBuilder/data

  <Directory "/Users/cburck/OfficeBuilder/OfficeBuilder/">
      Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


4) Make /Users/cburck/OfficeBuilder/OfficeBuilder/data fully accessible to web server.

5) Create MySQL database "OfficeBuilder", and create MySQL user "OfficeBuilder" with password "OfficeBuilderLocal" (this is set in applications/configs/application.ini)

6) Apply scripts/schema.sql to database "OfficeBuilder"

7) Apply default data set scripts/data.sql to database "OfficeBuilder"

8) Create users and enjoy
